# Cardio Frequency Meter

## Overview
The Cardio Frequency Meter project is designed to measure heart rate using a sensor and display the data in real-time. This project aims to provide an accurate and user-friendly way to monitor cardiovascular health.

## Objectives
1. **Heart Rate Measurement**: Accurately measure the user's heart rate.
2. **Real-Time Display**: Show heart rate data in real-time.
3. **User-Friendly Interface**: Ensure the system is easy to use and understand.

## Key Features
- **Heart Rate Sensor**: Utilizes a sensor to detect heartbeats.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Continuously displays heart rate data.
- **Data Visualization**: Graphical representation of heart rate over time.

## Technologies
- **Arduino**: Microcontroller for processing sensor data.
- **Pulse Sensor**: Hardware component for detecting heartbeats.
- **LCD Display**: Screen for real-time data visualization.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lucasolerr/projet-cardio-frequence-metre-ing1.git
   ```
2. Connect the hardware components (Arduino, Pulse Sensor, LCD Display).
3. Upload the provided Arduino sketch to the Arduino board.

## Usage
1. Power on the Arduino.
2. Place the pulse sensor on your fingertip or earlobe.
3. Observe the real-time heart rate data on the LCD display.
